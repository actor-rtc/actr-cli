# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

An Actor-RTC service implementation.

## Setup

First, install service dependencies to get proto files:

```bash
actr install
```

## Building

```bash
actr gen --input proto --output src/generated
```

## Running

```bash
actr run
```

## Development

This project uses the Actor-RTC framework. The main logic is implemented in `src/lib.rs`.

After running `actr install`, the service definition proto files will be in `protos/remote/`, and the implementation is in the `{{PROJECT_NAME_PASCAL}}Actor` struct.
